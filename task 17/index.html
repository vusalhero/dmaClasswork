        <h2>Good ol' Luck</h2>
        <p>Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!</p>
       
        <p>How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.</p>

        <p>Run, Luke! Run!</p>

        <h4>What happened to Alderaan?</h4>

        <p>Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!</p>

        <h4>The rebels must fight back!</h4>
        <p>And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!</p>
        <p>Run, Luke! Run!</p>

            <h2>The Empire Strikes Back!</h2>
            <p>Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you.</p>
            <h4>What do you want?</h4>
            <p>Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her. Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer!</p>
            <h4>Well done</h4>
            <p>Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.</p>
